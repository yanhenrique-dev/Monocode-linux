# Contributing

MonoCode Linux is maintained by [yanhenrique-dev](https://github.com/yanhenrique-dev) and targets **Linux only**. Small and focused lands much faster than large and ambitious. Past that, the door is open - bug reports and fixes are genuinely welcome.

Please don’t open PRs that add a new provider right now. The existing harnesses still need to agree on a few patterns, and a new adapter would copy whatever is there today. See [New providers](#new-providers).

## Get it running

You need Node.js 20+, a current stable Rust toolchain, and at least one provider CLI installed and logged in:

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) - `claude auth login`
- [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) - `codex login`
- [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) - `agent login`
- [Grok Build](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview) - `curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash` then `grok login`
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) - `opencode auth login`
- [Pi](https://pi.dev/) - `npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
- [omp](https://omp.sh) - `curl -fsSL https://omp.sh/install | sh`
- [fx](https://fx.sh) - `curl -fsSL https://fx.sh/setup.sh | bash` then `fx login`
- [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) - Linux: `curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash`; then run `hermes model`

Linux is the only supported target. On Debian/Ubuntu, `npm run setup:linux:deb` installs the native Tauri build dependencies.

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

One provider is enough. MonoCode probes for each CLI at startup and disables the ones it can’t find, with a hint about how to install them, so a missing Codex doesn’t stop you from working on anything else.

## Where things live

- `src/chrome/` - the window frame: title bar, sidebar, composer, tabs, model picker
- `src/surfaces/` - the panes inside a tab: transcript, file editor, diff, terminal
- `src/lib/harness/` - one adapter per provider, plus the registry they plug into
- `src-tauri/src/` - the Rust side: PTYs, filesystem and git, session storage, native window

`src/lib/harness/` is the most useful place to start if you want to fix something real. Each provider has an adapter (`claudeAdapter.ts`) that implements the shared `HarnessAdapter` lifecycle from `registry.ts`, and a protocol module (`claudeProtocol.ts`) that translates the CLI’s output into MonoCode’s own event types. The protocol modules are pure functions with unit tests beside them, so you can fix a Codex parsing bug with only Claude Code installed. That’s for the providers we already ship - please don’t add a new one yet.

## Before you push

```bash
npm run check
```

That runs what CI runs: vitest, `tsc --noEmit`, `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`. If it’s green locally it should be green on GitHub. `npm run check:web` and `npm run check:rust` run the two halves separately when you only touched one side.

## New providers

I’m pausing new harnesses until the current ones share the same patterns - session lifecycle, catalog probes, usage, approvals, and how slash commands and skills are wired. A PR that adds another provider will be closed for now, even if the work is good. Fixes, tests, and protocol bugs on Claude, Codex, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, Pi, omp, fx, and Hermes Agent are still the best kind of contribution.

When the pause lifts, this section goes away.

## Pull requests

Keep a PR to one thing, and say what changed and why. The [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) covers the rest. If it changes the UI, a before/after screenshot helps a lot.

For anything that moves product direction - a new surface, new provider behavior, a refactor that changes the shape of the app - open an issue first. That’s not gatekeeping, I’d just rather you hear “I’m already halfway through that” before you write it than after. New providers are the exception: don’t send the adapter, even from an issue, until the pause above is gone.

I might close a PR, ask you to shrink it, or end up implementing the idea differently. That’s a call about scope and timing, not about you or the quality of your work.
